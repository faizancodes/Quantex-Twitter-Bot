# Quantex-Twitter-Bot
This is a twitter bot I developed that utilizes web scraping to find key data and insights on stocks. The program features multiple functions which have the ability to find the top performing stocks for the week, stocks that have the highest ROE compared to their industry average, find stocks with the lowest PEG ratios, and much more. I run the program on the Google Cloud platform and it tweets automatically straight to the @quantexbot twitter account.
